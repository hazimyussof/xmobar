#+title: xmobar is now at https://codeberg.org/xmobar/xmobar

* Project moved to Codeberg

This project is currently [[https://codeberg.org/jao/xmobar/][hosted on Codeberg]].  Hosting in Github is not ideal;
GitHub is a proprietary, trade-secret system that is not Free and Open Souce
Software (FOSS).  We are deeply concerned about using a proprietary system
like GitHub to develop our FOSS project.  We have [[issue#636][an open issue]] where the
project contributors are actively discussing how we moved away from GitHub.
We urge you to read about the [[https://GiveUpGitHub.org][Give up campaign]] from the [[https://sfconservancy.org][Software Freedom
Conservancy]] to understand some of the reasons why GitHub is not a good place
to host FOSS projects.

Any use of this project's code by GitHub Copilot, past or present, is done
without our permission.  We do not consent to GitHub's use of this project's
code in Copilot.
